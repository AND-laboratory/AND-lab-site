### The Adolescent NeuroDevelopment (AND) Lab

The AND Lab is part of [the School of Psychological Sciences](https://www.monash.edu/medicine/psych/home) at Monash University, located on Kulin Lands in Melbourne, Australia. It falls under the [Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health](https://www.monash.edu/turner-institute). 

The lab head is Dr. Michelle Byrne, Ph.D. (she/her). Her research profile can be found [here](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/michelle-byrne).

#### Major research aims:
My research and knowledge focus on sensitive periods of brain development and puberty using longitudinal and multi-method data. Neurobiological development related to social processing and self-identity during puberty is critical for healthy development. Peer social-evaluative stress related to self-identity (i.e., “self-social stress”) shows observable neural, hormonal, and immune (i.e., neurobiological) responses. Adolescents with more reactive neurobiological systems to self-social stress may be more at risk for developing depression. Conversely, there are factors such as high levels of social support, that may protect against this risk. My PhD and postdoctoral training focused examining these associations in adolescent girls. My current program of research at Monash focuses on LGBTIQA+ adolescents and youth, because there are salient issues specific to LGBTIQA+ adolescent development of self-identity and social relationships that occur during puberty. The aim is to work with LGBTIQA+ communities and allies in a co-design framework and eventually provide evidence to inform public policy and education. This evidence should motivate us, as a broader society, to function in a more inclusive and less violent way, and ultimately reduce mental health disparities in this community.
