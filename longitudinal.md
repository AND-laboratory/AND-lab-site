### The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Longitudinal Models

My colleague Dr. Ethan McCormick created a [code companion](https://e-m-mccormick.github.io/static/longitudinal-primer/) to a paper (preprint [available here](https://psyarxiv.com/ga4qz)) that we published together with Drs. Jennifer Pfeifer, John Flournoy and Kate Mills.

The paper focuses on choices for modelling frameworks employed by developmental neuroscientists when working with longitudinal data. It includes a summary of the theory behind different models, as well as references to link neuroimaging researchers with more traditional statistical resources and backgrounds.

However, the [code companion](https://e-m-mccormick.github.io/static/longitudinal-primer/) itself is an interactive way to get hands-on experience with a simulated dataset to practice fitting longituindal data to multilevel models, generalized additive mixed models, latent curve models, and latent change score models, as well as how to handle nonlinear trajectories, time varying and invariant covariates, and more.
