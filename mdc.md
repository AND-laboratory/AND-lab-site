### Modelling Developmental Change

Longitudinal data sets are becoming more frequent as the importance of within-subject prospective data is acknowledged for preventative science. In particular, special methodological and analytic issues have arisen for neuroimaging data. Since 2016 I have been funded with Dr. Kate Mills by a series of grants from the University of Oregon, the National Science Foundation (NSF; US), and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH; US), to hold meetings and workshops to determine and teach best practices in this field. The 2016 meeting that I initiated at the University of Oregon set out a framework for addressing the challenges of this work.

Together with Drs. Jennifer Pfeifer, Nick Allen, and Kate Mills, I also guest edited a special issue of Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience titled [Methodological Challenges in Developmental Neuroimaging: Contemporary Approaches and Solutions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/developmental-cognitive-neuroscience/vol/33/suppl/C). This collection brought together papers focused on  solutions to special analysis questions in developmental neuroimaging, including domains of functional MRI, structural MRI, diffusion MRI, magnetic resonance elastography, computational neuroscience, missing data, risk taking tasks.

### Modeling Developmental Change: Practical Integration of Advanced Neuroimaging and Statistical Methods (2017)

Held as a preconference workshop to the Flux Congress in 2017, and funded by the NSF this workshop focused on initial dissemination of the results from the 2016 meeting. Longitudinal MRI datasets require special consideration for processing and analysis, yet the field as a whole had not standardized best practices for these datasets, which could be one reason why it is difficult to replicate results across laboratories and research studies. A two-day workshop (roughly split between fMRI and sMRI analyses on each day) taught best practices for processing, analyzing, modeling, and interpreting longitudinal neuroimaging data. The aim was to help researchers conduct robust and consistent research on how the brain and cognition change across development.

The slides and code from presenters at this workshop are publicly available via the [website](https://mdc-2017.github.io/) and the attached [github repository](https://github.com/mdc-2017/)

### ABCD Workshops
#### #1: ABCD Workshop on Brain Development in Relation to Mental Health (2019)
This project funded by NIMH was a five-day immersive workshop in Portland, Oregon, focused on using the [ABCD Study](https://abcdstudy.org/) dataset for investigations of brain development in relation to mental health. This workshop focused on reproducible neuroimaging methods, predictive modeling approaches, and clinical mental health outcomes, with equal emphasis on theory and application. It brought together the scientists who are currently developing the tools to conduct predictive modeling analyses on the neuroimaging components of the ABCD dataset with the community of researchers who will utilize these tools.

Information about the 2019 workshop is available on the [website](https://abcdworkshop.github.io/past-workshops/2019/).

#### #2:Modeling Developmental Change in the ABCD Study: Longitudinal Analyses for Clinical Outcomes (20210)
The workshop was held virtually due to the pandemic, and was a follow-up to the successful ABCD workshop for cross-sectional analyses that we organized in 2019. It focused on enhancing the rigor and reproducibility of ABCD data analyses by teaching participants how to develop and apply best practices in open science and longitudinal modeling in large datasets. To solidify their newly acquired knowledge and skills, participants formed teams and worked on projects that applied longitudinal modeling to relate functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures to mental health related outcomes. 

Information about the 2021 workshop is available on the [website](https://abcdworkshop.github.io/).
